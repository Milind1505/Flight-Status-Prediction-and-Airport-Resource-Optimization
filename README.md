# Flight Status Prediction and Airport Optimization

## Project Description

This project aims to predict flight status (scheduled, delayed, or canceled) and optimize airport resource allocation to minimize delays and improve overall efficiency. It utilizes machine learning models and optimization techniques to achieve these goals.

## Key Features

* **Flight Status Prediction:** Predicts the status of flights based on various factors like departure time, flight distance, weather conditions, and historical data.
* **Airport Resource Optimization:** Optimizes the allocation of airport resources, such as gates and ground staff, to minimize turnaround time and potential delays.
* **Simulation:** Simulates airport operations to assess the effectiveness of the optimization strategy and understand its impact on airport performance.
* **Model Interpretability:** Provides insights into the factors driving flight predictions and the relationship between features and outcomes.

## Data Sources

* **AviationStack API:** Used to collect real-time flight data.
* **Weather Data:** Integrated from external sources (e.g., weather APIs).
* **Airport Delay Data:** Obtained from historical records or relevant databases.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:** Collect flight data using the AviationStack API, weather data from external sources, and airport delay data. Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Explore the data to understand its structure, identify patterns, and gain insights into potential relationships between features and flight status.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create new features from the existing data to enhance the predictive power of the model.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict flight status. Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
5. **Airport Resource Optimization:** Develop an optimization model (e.g., using linear programming) to allocate airport resources effectively and minimize delays.
6. **Simulation:** Simulate airport operations with the optimized resource allocation to assess its impact on overall performance.
7. **Model Interpretability:** Utilize techniques like SHAP values to understand the factors driving flight predictions and gain insights into model behavior.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language for data analysis, machine learning, and optimization.
* **Pandas:** Library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
* **XGBoost:** Gradient boosting library for high-performance machine learning.
* **PuLP:** Linear programming library for optimization.
* **SHAP:** Library for model interpretability.
